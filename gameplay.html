			<p>Dr. Mario is a puzzle game in a similar style to Tetris. 
				 The game is played on a 8x16 board, with 2 exceptions:
				 Dr. Mario (Game Boy) on a 8x15, and Dr. Mario World on a 8x11
			</p>
			<p>Pills will appear from the top-centre of the board and fall down, pressing left/right move the pills Left/Right,
			Down moves the pills down faster, A rotates the pill clockwise, B rotates the pill counter-clockwise,
			and in some of the newer games Up makes the pill go as far down as they can go instantly.   
			</p>
			<p>Every pill has 2 segments, and will choose 1 of the colour sets:
			Red, Blue, and Yellow; or Magenta, Cyan, and Green, and viruses will have colours corresponding to the pill's, when 4+ of the same colour line up
			the pills and viruses will disappear and award points.  If the other half of the pills 
			(assuming they were not used to achieve the 4+ in a row) will fall, if the fallen pills clear
			more viruses you will create a combo, which will award bonus points (and send garbage in
			multiplayer).  The points are as follows.			
			</p>
			
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Combo</th> <th>Points</th> <th>Garbage</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>0</th> <th>200</th>  <th>0</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>1</th> <th>400</th>  <th>2</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>2</th> <th>800</th>  <th>3</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>3</th> <th>1600</th> <th>4</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>4</th> <th>3200</th> <th>5</th>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The number of viruses correspond to the current level. 0 - 4, 5 - 24, 10 - 44, etc.  The highest level is 24 on most releases.</p>

			<h2>Gameplay (Dr. Mario World)</h2>
			<hr/>
			<p>Dr. Mario World is a puzzle game similar to Tetris.
			   the game is played on a 8x11 board</p>
			<p>Pills are located at the bottom of the screen in a circle you can drag the pills to where you want,
			but after they move up a space they can't go back down, and tapping the pill will rotate it clockwise.
			</p>
			<p>Every pill has 2 segments, for normal levels the colours are:
			Red, Blue, and Yellow; and for challenge levels:
			Magenta, Cyan, and Green, and viruses will have colours corresponding to the pill's,
			when 3+ of the same colour line up
			the pills and viruses will disappear and award points.  If the other half of the pills 
			(assuming they were not used to achieve the 4+ in a row) will fall, and the sub pills can be
			move the same way as whole pills (minus rotating).
			</p>
			<p>In multiplayer after clearing enough viruses, or clearing all the viruses, will send you opponent
			more lines of viruses, if all the viruses are cleared you will receive 2 extra lines of viruses.
			The first one to hit the bottom of the screen loses.
